        The caller must provide a file name for each document, which will be used
        in case of a multi-status response

        to identify which documents failed to upload. The file name can be provided
        in the `Content-Disposition` header

        of the file part or in the `fileName` field of the metadata. You can add a
        parallel array of metadata objects. These

        are matched with the files based on index, and must have the same length as
        the files array.

        To pass homogenous metadata for all files, spread the metadata over the metadata
        array.

        A filename value provided explicitly via the metadata array in the request
        overrides the `Content-Disposition` header

        of the file part.


        In case of a multi-status response, the response body will contain a list
        of `DocumentBatchProblemDetail` objects,

        each of which contains the file name of the document that failed to upload
        and the reason for the failure.

        The client can choose to retry the whole batch or individual documents based
        on the response.

      summary: Delete resource
      description: 'Deletes a deployed resource. This can be a process definition,
        decision requirements

        definition, or form definition deployed using the deploy resources endpoint.
        Specify the

        resource you want to delete in the `resourceKey` parameter.


        Once a resource has been deleted it cannot be recovered. If the resource needs
        to be

        available again, a new deployment of the resource is required.


        By default, only the resource itself is deleted from the runtime state. To
        also delete the

        historic data associated with a resource, set the `deleteHistory` flag in
        the request body

        to `true`. The historic data is deleted asynchronously via a batch operation.
        The details of

        the created batch operation are included in the response. Note that history
        deletion is only

        supported for process resources; for other resource types this flag is ignored
        and no history

        will be deleted.'
